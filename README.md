The DADA2 scripts to process 16S rRNA gene reads might take a long time to run and are available in the folder /DADA2. If you try to reproduce those steps, be careful with file paths, names, etc.

Raw FASTQ files are available in ENA, see Data Availability statement of the article.

We reproduced our code in a Linux (Fedora v38) machine, R version 4.3.2
